# What's the Weather?
Hi! üëãüèª

[*What's the Weather?*](https://anurag87398.github.io/whatsTheWeather/) is a simple frontend weather forecasting project made with the help of the good old trio of plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Feel free to read this documentation for the knowing the various features that this project provides.

Additionally, you can also checkout my [Devlogs](https://github.com/Anurag87398/whatsTheWeather/blob/master/devlog.md) for having an idea of how I went by creating this project üòâ

<br>

## Motivation
- The main motivation behind building this project was to apply my web development knowledge that I gained in the past few weeks.
- Specifically speaking, I wanted to have a more hands on experience on the following Javascript concepts:
    - Asynchronous Javascript
    - Promises
    - Working with APIs
    - Modules
- By working with multiple APIs in this project I was able to understand the working of this fundamentals in depth which would surely help me in my future works.
- CSS responsiveness has always been a challenge and so this project was another oppurtunity for me to work on my styling skills as well.

## Features
- *What's the Weather?* allows users to get the weather forecast of any place that they want to search for, or just simply fetch their current location if they allow so.
- Using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (and a few other) API(s), this project provides weather info for 7 days.
- The user is provided stats like current, apparant, maximum & minimum temperatures, humidity, precipitation, wind speeds, both daily and hourly
- With the help of [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), I was able to plot beautiful and responsive charts of this numeric data for better visual understanding of the user.
- For a detailed info of all the APIs and functions used in this project, you can refer my [Devlogs](https://github.com/Anurag87398/whatsTheWeather/blob/master/devlog.md).

## Additional Info
- In case the current location feature is not working on your handheld devices, make sure that you have location services enabled and then try again. If the error still persists, kindly search for your locality :')
- As this is only a frontend project without any frameworks, it wasn't possible to hide the API keys that I've used in this project. Thus, as a fellow developer, I'd kindly request you to not use my API keys for your own work as they have a request limit :') 
- These are free API keys so you can generate for yourself as well! üçª
